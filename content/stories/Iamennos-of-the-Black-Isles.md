Iamennos stared at the far wall of his cell. The black stone glistened in the weak lamplight, tiny water droplets clinging to its cool surface. The room was small, perhaps 6 feet wide and 8 feet deep, and barely 6 feet tall. The entire dungeon had been carved into a massive underground ledge of black granite, the stone that gave the Black Isles their name. Iamennos thought it odd that they had committed such a large chunk of their potential exports to such an extravagant prison, but then that was how the nobility of the Isles liked to do things.

A guard clinked past on the other side of the thick wooden door, not even bothering to glance through the small barred window. He was barely alive, barely even able to stand, having been locked in this cell for... he couldn't remember. Not a threat. Not even worth jeering at or spitting on anymore, apparently. When he had been arrested for whatever petty crime it had been this time, it was a point of pride to the guards to abuse him. They had captured a devil, they said, one of Asmodeus' own. Idiots. He wasn't even Asmodean. He had tried telling them as much, but that had only made it worse. Of course.

In a way he missed those early years, beatings and all. At least there was pain. Something. Anything to tell him that he was really still alive. Now he sat on his rotted bed roll, feeling as dead as the stone that surrounded him.
