{{\<lead>}}If you've been on the World Wide Web over the past few years and have even a passing interest in software development, there's a pretty good chance you've heard someone mention the Rust programming language.{{\</lead>}}

If you've been following me on the World Wide Web over the past few years (like on [fedi](https://mecha.garden/@emerald), say), then you've definitely heard someone mention the Rust programming language. Indeed it seems that for anyone in and around the greater """developer""" space online, Rust is nigh inescapable. Rust's popularity and the \~\~cult\~\~ community that has grown up around it has of course already been discussed to death and back again, so it's a good thing that that isn't quite what I want to focus on with this post. Recently I've been writing more non-rust than Rust in my various "side projects", and I want to try to articulate why I keep crawling back to Rust despite the things it does to me.
