Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are games that I've been ~~morbidly~~ looking forwards to since their reveal in early 2022. After the breath of fresh air for the franchise that was Pokemon Legends: Arceus, I was excited to see where Game Freak would take the series next. But, trailer after trailer it seemed that things weren't shaping up to be quite what I had hoped. There were improvements, yes, but so many of the issues that were present in every Pokemon game release for the Switch so far appeared to still be present. Of course, all we could do was wait and see.

Now we've waited, and so it's time to see. This will be my very first impressions of the game (I'm playing Violet) after about an hour of play. I've been taking my time and so haven't gotten very deep into the story yet, but I feel like I've gotten a good look at the most basic pieces that make up the rest of the game. That said, lets start with:

## 1. The good

Right off the bat, this generation introduces you to the game with a fully animated cutscene. It's dynamic, and shows off something that I think these games have going for them: character expressions. This isn't the usual Pokemon afair of characters awkwardly walking, turning, walking again, then doing a canned animation sequnce. While there is some of that in the game itself, the intro is has real animation, with characters that really react to what they're seeing in a believable way, and a way that adds to their characterization. There *are* issues with the cutscenes but we'll get to that later. 

Continuing with the theme of improved animations, your selection of partner Pokemon have immediately apparent and lovable personalities in a way that Pokemon in Sword and Shield and even Arceus didn't. Their animations are expressive and well done, and reminiscent of the Pokemon anime and the antics that often ensue therein. Similarly, the human characters are well animated with the same sense of personality. The text boxes for their dialog even changes to match their temperment. All of the models, both human and Pokemon, are also well made with a good level of detail. The Pokemon also have texture now rather than being smooth, plasticy creatures of clean lines and solid colors.

Another thing this gen gets right is character customization. This has been an inclusion since Sword and Shield of course, but Scarlet and Violet starts off with character creation heretofore unseen in a Pokemon game. You can change your eye shape and color, lash shape and color, brow shape and color, mouth shape and lip color, skin tone, hair color and style, and even chose from a few different beauty marks. All of the choices even have a decent number of options as well, a few more than seen in previous iterations of the same system. I assume you are able to customize your clothing too, though I haven't gotten far enough for that yet as you start out in your school uniform.

## 2. The meh

Somewhat alarmingly I have yet to mention anything to do with the actual gameplay. This is largely because these games, like so many before them, are Pokemon games. Now it should be noted that Scarlet and Violet are true open world games, not confining the player to a single quest line or forcing you down a single path to progress. You can walk around, fall off things, find items and berries lying on the gound, and whatever else to your heart's content before the game even really starts. *But*, when it comes to the core gameplay (i.e. battles), it is much the same as it ever was. There are some improvements in this area: you aren't transported to a pocket dimension during a battle, they happen right in the overworld with minimal transitons, there's a shortcut for getting to your pokeballs in wild Pokemon battles, and overall the battle interface looks pretty nice and is unintrusive. But the battle styles from Arceus, which I thought added a lot of interest and opportunity for strategy, are gone, replaced by yet another mega-evolution knock-off (and a pretty silly looking one at that).

Battle animations are also as "okay" as ever. For what they are, they're pretty good (for the new Pokemon at least) and continue the trend of more expressive animations across the board. But they are still the same as they have been since the switch to 3D. Because I haven't gotten very far I can't say whether or not there are any Mega Blastoise-level effect misalignments, but the animations I've seen so far certainly aren't tailored to the move that the pokemon is doing.
