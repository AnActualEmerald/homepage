I would like to consider myself a fan of strategy games, though realistically I don't actually play them that much. Still, I was intrigued when I stumbled upon [Beyond all Reason](https://beyondallreason.info), an open-source RTS game that hails from the proud lineage of *Total Annihilation* descendants. If you've never heard of TA, perhaps you've heard of one of its more mainstream derivatives *Supreme Commander*.

 [beyondallreason.info](https://beyondallreason.info) is. An exhaustive list of units for both factions, a similarly comprehensive list of available commands and their default key binds, and even some basic guides all make the website a great resource for new players. In addition to all that there's also the [leaderboards](https://www.beyondallreason.info/leaderboards), a list of [currently active games](https://www.beyondallreason.info/active-battles), and even *[all of the replays](https://www.beyondallreason.info/replays)*. If you're going to have a website for your game, *this* is how you should do it.
