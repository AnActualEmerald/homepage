[Beyond all Reason](https://beyondallreason.info) is the most recent incarnation of the classic large-scale RTS *Total Annihilation*. It is an open source project created by a community of RTS fans and has recently seen a large influx of players and attention due to a slew of videos from strategy gaming streamer and youtuber [Winter Gaming](https://twitch.tv/wintergaming). Being a fan of *Supreme Commander*, another TA descendant, I was immediately intrigued to see a "new" game in that genre being made and decided to check it out. This is my first impressions of the game from the perspective of someone who really likes the idea of RTS games but has never had much success actually playing them.

Before we actually get to the game, I think its important to highlight just how good [beyondallreason.info](https://beyondallreason.info) is. An exhaustive list of units for both factions, a similarly comprehensive list of available commands and their default key binds, and even some basic guides all make the website a great resource for new players. In addition to all that there's also the [leaderboards](https://www.beyondallreason.info/leaderboards), a list of [currently active games](https://www.beyondallreason.info/active-battles), and even *[all of the replays](https://www.beyondallreason.info/replays)*. If you're going to have a website for your game, *this* is how you should do it.

Anyways, this is a review of a game, not a website. It should be noted that BAR is still being actively developed (the dev team is calling it alpha-quality software thought its more complete and stable than a lot of full releases), so there are things that are missing or may be subject to change as time pushes inexorably forward. That said, the current state of the game it *pretty good*. One of the key differences between BAR and, say, Supreme Commander, is that BAR maps are typically scaled down quite a bit.
