I go by Emerald in a lot of places on the internet. I'm 
a big fan of mecha anime and when I'm not working on a 
project or building gunpla, I'm usually playing League of Legends with friends.
                
I am a self taught developer who loves taking on side projects that 
I usually lack the requisite skills for. Rust has been my go-to language 
for exactly that kind of project for the past few years. I have also written a few things in Node.js (mostly Discord bots), 
and am currently in the process of exploring Deno. You can see some of the things 
I'm proud of over on the [projects](/projects) page.
                                                                                                                    
What first drew me to programming was a desire to make my own Minecraft mods. I watched a lot of tutorials on YouTube, got my Eclipse IDE set up, and made [this](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/burrito-mod-v10/), 
a mod which added mineable beans among some other things. Sadly the source for that mod is long gone by now as I wouldn't discover version control for another few years.
After that, I moved on to C#, and even tried wrangling C++ for a bit. Throughout highschool I hacked away on my school-issued netbook, writing 
everything from a 3D renderer to a chat server and client.
                                                                                  
Nowadays, with all of [crates.io](https://crates.io) as my disposal, I feel encouraged to explore some of the murkier areas of computing. Compilers and interpreters especially interest me,
and I've already written one [language](https://github.com/AnActualEmerald/BerylScript), and participated in the first [lang-jam](https://github.com/langjam/jam0001/tree/main/AnActualEmerald).
As I wrap up a few other things I'm "working" on, I intend to really dive into interpreters and bytecode, and perhaps attempt to write a language someone could actually use.</p>
