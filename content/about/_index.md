I go by Emerald in most places on the internet. I like to roleplay
as a system admin by running my own [firefish](https://joinfirefish.org) 
[instance](https://mecha.garden) and a bunch of self-hosted services for
myself and my family. I spend a shocking amount of my free time writing
code for `fun`, usually in Rust but occasionally in TypeScript by way
of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) or [Deno](https://deno.land). I like to 
think of myself as the kind of person that *would* watch mecha anime,
if I ever took the time to actually watch anything.

This is my personal website for when I want to write about stuff that 
would be better suited not being a post on [insert microblogging service here].
Don't expect it to be updated very often as my thoughts are relatively short lived.
Follow me on the [fediverse](https://mecha.garden/@emerald) if you want to see
my inane ramblings.
