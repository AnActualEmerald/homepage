<p>At last, the long wait has come to a close. I am officially opening my website to the world! It&rsquo;s been a long time coming,
but I finally found what it was I was looking for. As I had suspected, I was going about building a website in an incredibly
wrong way. Previously I had been trying to write myself a server that would essentially act as a CMS, wherein I would send a
document to the server, then the server would <em>serve</em> that to the front end when requested. But I have learned something important
in the interim: Not everything has to be an SPA.</p>
<p>Web development is certainly not my forte, so most of my issues in getting this site off the ground have been rooted firmly in
my own ignorance as to how these sorts of things are usually done. As it happens, static sites are pretty useful for this sort of thing,
and what&rsquo;s more is that there are quite a few tools to make <em>creating</em> static sites as painless as possible. I have landed on using Hugo
for now, though as this is my first time using a static site generator I may move to something else in the future. 11ty looked interesting,
but Hugo&rsquo;s proposition of not having to have anything to do with Node was more than convincing enough for me.</p>
<p>I look forward to experimenting with this new posting format. A kind of macro-tweet, if you will. That&rsquo;s all for this inaugural post though. Until next time!</p>
