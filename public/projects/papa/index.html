<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>One of the first projects I&rsquo;ve started that was born out of a need that I had that
wasn&rsquo;t being met by existing software. <a href="https://northstar.tf/">Northstar</a> is a modding framework for the
game Titanfall 2, a game near and dear to my heart as one of the few games I&rsquo;ve
played that really gets the feel of mecha right. Sadly it has been left in a state of
limbo by the developers and publisher, leaving the servers vulnerable to hackers and DDOS attacks,
among other things. Northstar is a project that aims to pivot the game to be as community driven as it can be
without access to the source of the game itself. At time of writing this consists of a community server browser
and mods for gameplay and some limited visuals (custom maps, models, and animations are very much a work in progress).</p>
<p>After starting a server myself on a VPS service, I found that there was no good process for installing serverside mods without
a GUI. Technically it is possible to <code>curl</code> or <code>wget</code> the zip files that the mods come packed in, but unzipping them and moving
everything to the right folder was a bit too tedious for me. This is where <code>papa</code> comes in</p>
<h3 id="the-project">The project</h3>
<p>What I was looking for was a package manager; something along the lines of Debian&rsquo;s <code>apt</code>. There are a number of other options, namely <a href="https://github.com/0neGal/viper">Viper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BigSpice/VTOL">VTOL</a>,
but both involve relatively heavy GUI dependencies and, until recently, VTOL didn&rsquo;t officially support Linux at all. It should be mentioned that Viper does have a CLI, but it is tied to the rest of the
main Electron application. Obviously bringing the entire Electron stack into a headless server environment is ineffecient at best.</p>
<p>I set about thinking through the steps that would be required to install a mod.</p>
