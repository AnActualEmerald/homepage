    <p>I go by Emerald in a lot of places on the internet. I&rsquo;m
a big fan of mecha anime and when I&rsquo;m not working on a
project or building gunpla, I&rsquo;m usually playing League of Legends with friends.</p>
<p>I am a self taught developer who loves taking on side projects that
I usually lack the requisite skills for. Rust has been my go-to language
for the past few years, and in fact this website is running on a very small <a href="https://rocket.rs/">rocket.rs</a> server.
I have also written a few things in Node.js, and am currently in the process of exploring Deno. You can see some of the things
I&rsquo;m proud of over on the projects page.</p>
<p>What first drew me to programming was a desire to make my own Minecraft mods. I watched a lot of tutorials on YouTube, got my Eclipse IDE set up, and made <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/burrito-mod-v10/">this</a>,
a mod which added mineable beans among some other things. Sadly the source for that mod is long gone by now as I wouldn&rsquo;t discover version control for another few years.
After that, I moved on to C# , and even tried wrangling C++ for a bit. Throughout highschool I hacked away on my school-issued netbook, writing
everything from a 3D renderer to a chat server and client.</p>
<p>Nowadays, with all of <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> as my disposal, I feel encouraged to explore some of the murkier areas of computing. Compilers and interpreters especially interest me,
and I&rsquo;ve already written one <a href="https://github.com/AnActualEmerald/BerylScript">language</a>, and participated in the first <a href="https://github.com/langjam/jam0001/tree/main/AnActualEmerald">lang-jam</a>.
As I wrap up a few other things I&rsquo;m &ldquo;working&rdquo; on, I intend to really dive into interpreters and bytecode, and perhaps attempt to write a language someone could actually use.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
